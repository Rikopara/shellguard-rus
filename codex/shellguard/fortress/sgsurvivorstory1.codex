I got a job as a Peacekeeper today! I'm so excited! I've longed to be one ever since I was a kid and now that I finally am, I can't quite believe it!",

    "^cyan;Personal log number 257:^white; 
My first few days were hard! I had no idea that poptops could grow to be so large! These outer systems are pretty dangerous, but I'm going to make them safer!",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 263:^white; 
I'm saving my pixels bit by bit. One day, I'm going to go home. Well... not literal home. The home of the human species, Earth. I've heard that it's beautiful.",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 268:^white; 
Arrested a gang member today. They had some kind of a plan to attack the Protectorate. Why would anyone want to do that? I don't understand them at all. They protect the Earth! I... Well, actually, I guess I also do too! One day, I'll get there... It just seems so far away.",

I've been tasked with protecting a small research team from Earth! I can't wait to meet them! I have so many questions!",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 279:^white; 
Wow, just wow. This day has been something special! Not only did I learn so much from the team, one of them is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen! She smiled at me so sweetly and she laughed at everything I said- not to mention she also loved my interest in the Earth! Should I ask her out?",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 281:^white; 
She said yes!"
