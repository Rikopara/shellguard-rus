    "^cyan;Personal log number 1820:^white; 
It's about time I continue these logs. I've been working under Ironwatch for many, many years now. I'm not getting any younger and this is a very dangerous job. A record of my life would be a nice thing to leave behind.",

    "^cyan;Personal log number 1823:^white;
I've been through more fights than I can remember. I've seen so many worlds, people, and places. I rarely get scared of anything, but now my stomach feels like a washing machine on the spin cycle. I'm finally doing it... I've been assigned as a bodyguard for an important Protectorate official- on Earth, of all places.",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 1825:^white;
The date of the assignment is getting closer. The job is easy enough; there's no danger on Earth- and yet, I'm still so nervous. Is it really as amazing as they say? For my entire life, I've always dreamed to go there. It used to be my passion and my life's goal... The funny thing now is that I've long since had the funds to go there myself, but I could just never find the time or the excuse to. Well, at least now I have a proper excuse to finally fulfill my dream.",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 1827:^white;
I'm recording this log on the shuttle en route to Earth. I can see it now- a tiny, pale, blue dot; it's getting closer and closer. There are so many lights on it, flickering and twinkling almost like a jewel of the heavens... It's just so pretty. I might actually need a tissue.",

	"^cyan;Personal log number 1830:^white;
I could never have imagined that the Earth was this beautiful. I wish they could have been here with me... I miss them dearly. My daughter would have loved it here. She always loved the oceans...",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 1833:^white;
Instead of feeling satisfied from my visit, I'm left feeling bitter and angry; I feel like there's a knot twisting and wrenching in my gut. I'm tense and frustrated. Each and every time I look across this vast, green city and at the brilliant blue lakes below, I feel furious. They should have been here to see this. It isn't fair. ",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 1847:^white;
There was a small earthquake today, but everything else seems to be fine. My client is on their way to a Protectorate graduation ceremony taking place around the same time as some emergency meeting. I'll be standing guard at the doors.",

	"^cyan;Personal log number 1884:^white;
The Earth is gone now. So many lives lost. The majority of the Protectorate's main forces have been wiped out. I barely survived and escaped, but there's a part of me that wishes I hadn't. If I hadn't left the Peacekeepers, would this still have happened? If I hadn't joined Shellguard, my family and friends might not have died. If... If only I hadn't... If only I hadn't, none of this would have happened...",

	"^cyan;Personal log number 1921:^white;
No more questioning the past. I'm going to fix this. I'm going to make them pay. All of them. Both the Shellguard and that darned abomination writhing around on the fragments of the Earth. ^red;I am going to set things right.^white;"
