The honeymoon was fantastic! It cost a lot, but a vacation planet like that was worth it! Sure, set me back for about a year for my Earth travel funds, but what's another year after an experience like that?",

Huh... She's been acting so weird recently. I hope everything is okay...",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 446:^white;
Oh, my word! I can't believe it! This is the best day of my life! She's pregnant! Hah! It's all so surreal! At least now, all the late-night runs to the shop for Oculemon Meringue makes sense!",
	
    "^cyan;Personal log number 489:^white;
I'm a father now! It didn't really sink in until I held her in my hands. I have a daughter! She has her mother's hair and my big nose. Haha!",

	"^cyan;Personal log number 555:^white;
She's growing up so fast! My wife and I are so proud.",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 576:^white;
I've decided. I'm going to take them both to Earth one day. These outer systems are getting more and more dangerous. The problem is... the Peacekeepers don't pay very much. I remember my wife once told me that a mercenary company, called Shellguard, is always hiring. Can't say that I've ever heard of them, but the pay seems pretty good.",
	
	"^cyan;Personal log number 599:^white;
I quit my job today; got signed up with Shellguard instead. Even with choosing the safer bounties, we should still have enough money in no time. I'll be catching a shuttle to their nearest outpost tomorrow, but my family is staying behind; they should be safe here."
